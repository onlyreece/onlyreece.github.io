This is just one way but some of the tools and how I use them should be something you can take away and implement in whatever you do for you development of Web Resources within the CRM.
A few years ago I remember coming across a great blog post from Scott Durow (@scottdurow), he of SparkleXRM and Ribbon Workbench fame, which introduced me to Fiddler2 autoresponders for replacing CRM web resources on the server with local development copies to vastly improve the development process and speed.</description>
